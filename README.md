# Heuristics.TestEngineerEval

## How this works

Thank you for your interest in a Test Engineer position with Heuristic Solutions! (*If you haven't already had a screening call with us, please do that first!*) 

The purpose of this assessment is to create a code sample that we can collaboratively review in a technical interview. If you already have samples of your UI tests that you can share with us, those are acceptable too!

To keep things simple, you will write some UI tests against our publicly-accessible training instance so that you don't need to worry about installing anything locally (except your testing framework of choice).

## Setting up the system under test

You will be writing tests against our QA training site: [https://training.qa.learningbuilder.net/](https://training.qa.learningbuilder.net/)

We turn off our QA sites when they are not being used, so you may need to click a button to start it up:

It may take a few minutes to full start up.

## How to log in

The training site has a number of pre-created accounts. To make it easy, they are listed on the login page, and you can click on a name to log in as that persona.
